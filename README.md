# Titanic Kaggle Competition

## Introduction
This is the legendary Titanic ML competition – the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works. The competition aim is to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. As this is my first submission to Kaggle, the main goals are to learn more about data analysis and machine learning algorithms, as well as, get some practice with the most relevant Python libraries related to data science.

## Competition description
> The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage,  the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough    lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

> While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than > others. In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more > likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

## Goal
Our job is to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. For each in the test set, we must predict a 0 or 1 value for the variable.

## Metric
Our score is the percentage of passengers we correctly predict. This is known as accuracy.
