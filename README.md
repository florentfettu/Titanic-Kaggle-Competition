# Titanic-Kaggle-Competition

## Introduction
This is the legendary Titanic ML competition – the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works. The competition aim is to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. As this is my first submission to Kaggle, the main goals are to learn more about data analysis and machine learning algorithms, as well as, get some practice with the most relevant Python libraries related to data science.
